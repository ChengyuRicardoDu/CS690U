# CS690U
CS690U Final Project

Clustering biological sequences can help reveal functional or evolutionary relationships without the need for labeled data. In this project, we evaluated how well simple $k$-mer frequency features, combined with classical clustering algorithms, can recover known biological classes in two sequence datasets: E. coli noncoding RNAs and MopB family proteins. For RNA, where classes are defined by short, conserved motifs, $k$-mer clustering performed remarkably wellâ€”surpassing most foundation models. In contrast, for the MopB protein dataset, where functional signals are more subtle and distributed, foundation models clearly outperformed $k$-mers. We also observed that mid-layer embeddings from foundation models sometimes yielded better clustering than final layers, likely due to better retention of motif-level details. These findings highlight both the  power and  limitations of simple sequence features, and suggest that the choice of models should be guided by the biological structure of the data.

K-mer Test.ipynb contains the code to perform this test. Plots.rmd provides the code to draw two graphs of the results for reproduction.
